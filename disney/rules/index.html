    receive 100 points, for every wrong answer you get, it will deduct 100 points.

    be able to see the scores
  </p>
  <h2>
    We are working on making it possible for anyone to be able to see your score

    Info
    <p>
      Just a heads up, if your on mobile, you can open up Spotify, Apple Music
      or Youtube Music and not use our music section, because it will redrict
      you to the mobile app of Youtube and will not let you do the quiz with the
      music.
    </p>

# Quiz

Thanks for viewing the GitHub repo for my quiz.
I made this quiz, following a YouTube tutorial online by [Brian Designs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsKsymTY_4BYR-wytLjex7A). You can explore this repo, although if you want to do the quiz yourself, I suggest you don't open any "Javascript" files within the directory /data, because the .JS file there has all the answers to the quiz. I may delete the games directory, and create a private repo where I have everything + games directory, but for now that will cause me double work, so its fine as it is :).

Also, if your wondering, no this is not the same quiz as [Quiz in .Bat](https://github.com/KendallDoesCoding/Quiz-in-.bat), it's much more improved with more topics, etc and a more modern day design rather then just a command line game.

I would like to give a big shoutout to [@Hacikoi-the-creator](https://github.com/Hachikoi-the-creator) who made a huge revamp to this project (in v8.0.0)[Pull Request #29](https://github.com/KendallDoesCoding/quiz/pull/29).

## Important

Incase, music isn't playing for you, please do the following steps:

- Head over to to Google Sound Settings - <https://chrome://settings/content/sound?search=Sound>
- Set it to "Sites can play sound"

The issue should be fixed. Incase of any further issue, please file a [Bug Report](https://github.com/KendallDoesCoding/quiz/issues/new?assignees=&labels=%F0%9F%9B%A0+goal%3A+fix&template=bug.yml).

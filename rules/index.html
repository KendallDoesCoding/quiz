	Rules

	<p>
		There are 15 questions in this quiz, For every right answer you get, you
		receive 100 points, for every wrong answer you get, it will deduct 100
		points and won't go below zero.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can save you score to our website but for now, no-one else but you
		will be able to see the scores
	</p>
	<h2>
		We are working on making it possible for anyone to be able to see your
		score so we can host competitions of this quiz.
	</h2>

	<h1>
		Info
		<p>
			Just a heads up, if your on mobile, you can open up Spotify, Apple
			Music or Youtube Music and not use our music section, because it
			will redirect you to the mobile app of Youtube and will not let you
			do the quiz with the music.
		</p>

		<h3>Thanks,</h3>
